      <h2 class="mt-6">Description</h2>
      <p>
        For this choice, your grade is related to your ambition! For a B, you have a choice of either creating a flight simulator, or a platformer (details below).
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if you want an A, you need to make a game where you can do BOTH! FOr example, when the plane "lands", the player will "hop" out of the plane and have some task to complete.
      </p>
      <h3>Flight Simulator</h3>
      <p>
        While you are free to use my example code for to get you started, you will need to significantly enhance it.
        Here are some ideas of stuff to add (but feel free to come up with your own):
        <ul>
          <li>Build a world out of models from google poly?</li>
          <li>Have something interesting happen when you fly through rings?</li>
          <li>Have a fuel meter that decreases as you fly?</li>
          <li>Collect fuel to fill it back up?</li>
          <li>Flying enemies that chase you and shoot at you?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Platformer</h3>
      <p>
        Again, you can use my code to get you started, but you need to add significantly in order for it to get a good grade.
        Here are some ideas of stuff to add (but feel free to come up with your own):
        <ul>
          <li>Make "houses" that you can go in using ProBuilder</li>
          <li>Make it so you need to collect a "key" in order to unlock a door to win the game</li>
          <li>Have collectable ammunition and some sort of projectile</li>
          <li>Cool jumps (double jump, wall jump, rocket packs)</li>
          <li>Stomp on enemies to defeat them?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>BOTH!?!</h3>
      Again, in order to get an A on this assignment, you will need to make a game that has both flight simulator and platforming elements.

      <p>
        Feel free to start from this code, but you won't get very far with the assignment if you don't understand it, so look it over carefully.

      <h2 class="mt-6">Building your Project for the Web</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Open the Build Settings (File > Build Settings...)</li>
          <li>Click the Add Open Scenes button</li>
          <li>Select "WebGL" and then click the "Switch Platform" button</li>
          <li>Click the "Build" button</li>
          <li>
            When it asks you where you want to put your build, create a folder titled "web" in your game04 folder.
            Once you do this, it will take several minutes to build your game.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container pb-5">
      <h2 class="mt-6">Submission</h2>
      <p>
        Submit your project to github. Make sure your Unity project is titled "game04"
        and located in the "exercises" folder of your local github repository. To push it up
        to github, open Github Desktop, commit your changes (you need to enter a comment in the field on the bottom left of the screen),
        and click the "Push origin" button near the top middle of the screen.
      </p>

        If everything worked, you should be able to play your game by going to:<br>
