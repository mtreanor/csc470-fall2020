      <h2 class="mt-6">Description</h2>
      <p>
        This exercise is meant to give you the opportunity to creatively apply all of the
        <a href="#topics">topics we've covered so far<a>. The goal is to apply every one of the topics we've covered in
        class into a small game.
      </p>
      <p>Name your Unity project "game02".</p>
      <p>
        In this assignment, create as much of a game as possible that applies
        all of the <a href="#topics">topics</a> from class. This will involve
        conceiving of a small game that is made up of these technical topics. Constraints breed
        creativity!
      </p>
      <p>
        In class, be prepared to describe what you are attempting to create by the following week, as
        well as being able to specifically point out how you applied the technical topics. We will
        spend the majority of class helping one another understand the remaining topics.
      </p>

    <div class="container pb-5" id="topics">
      <h2 class="mt-6">Topics You Must Apply In Your Game</h2>
      <p>
        <ol type="A">
          <li>Creating and modfying 3d primitive shapes in the Unity Editor</li>
          <li>Creating and applying materials to Game Objects</li>
          <li>Changing the background color by editing the Main Camera's clear flag and background color</li>
          <li>Applying and configuring Rigidbody Physics components to Game Objects</li>
          <li>Creating and applying custom components to Game Objects</li>
          <li>Response to player input (Input.GetKeyDown(), Input.GetKey(), Input.GetAxis())</li>
          <li>Making use of a game object transform's 'forward' vector</li>
          <li>Computing the vector between two objects (and normalizing it)</li>
          <li>Scaling a movement vector by Time.deltaTime (through multiplication) in order to ensure smooth continuous movement</li>
          <li>Using GameObject.Find() to get references to other game objects in your scene</li>
          <li>Directly giving a custom component a reference to another game object by declaring a 'public GameObject' variable in your comonent, and assigning the value to that reference in the Unity Editor (Inspector)</li>
          <li>Making use of Random.Range() and Random.value to get random numbers</li>
          <li>Creating user interface elements</li>
          <li>Buttons: Calling a custom function when a button is clicked (the function needs to be 'public')</li>
          <li>Downloading and applying <a href="http://dafont.com">custom fonts</a> to Text objects</li>
          <li>Downloading and importing 3D models from <a href="http://poly.google.com">Google Poly</a></li>
          <li>Positioning an object's origin by creating empty game objects, and repositioning 'child' objects (this is necessary with many Google Poly models)</li>
          <li>Creating and configuring colliders (all game objects need to have a collider in order for Unity to recognize collisions - primitive 3d shapes have these by default, but imported Google Poly models need you to manually apply one)</li>
          <li>Creating prefabs</li>
          <li>Instantiating and configuring prefabs</li>
          <li>Triggers: Making it so the OnTriggerEnter function is called when two objects collide (both objects need colliders, at least on of the colliders must be marked as a "Trigger", and at least one of the objects needs to have a RigidBody component - you will often want to remove gravity and mark it as kinematic)</li>
          <li>The timer pattern: Create a float variable with a value of the time you want to count down from. Decrease that variable by Time.deltaTime in your Update function. When that variable is less than zero, perform the action you want to have happen, and reset the countdown variable.</li>

      <h2 class="mt-6">Mike's Example</h2>
      <p>
        Think small! Here's an example project that mostly satisfies the constraints of the assignment.
      </p>
      <a href="https://github.com/mtreanor/csc470-fall2020/blob/master/examples/basics/" class="btn btn-primary">CODE</a>
      <a href="http://mtreanor.com/csc470-fall2020/examples/basics/web/" class="btn btn-primary">PLAY </a>
    </div>

    <div class="container pb-5">
      <h2 class="mt-6">Building your Project for the Web</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Open the Build Settings (File > Build Settings...)</li>
          <li>Click the Add Open Scenes button</li>
          <li>Select "WebGL" and then click the "Switch Platform" button</li>
          <li>Click the "Build" button</li>
          <li>
            When it asks you where you want to put your build, create a folder titled "web" in your game02 folder.
            Once you do this, it will take several minutes to build your game.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container pb-5">
      <h2 class="mt-6">Submission</h2>
      <p>
        Submit your project to github. Make sure your Unity project is titled "game02"
        and located in the "exercises" folder of your local github repository. To push it up
        to github, open Github Desktop, commit your changes (you need to enter a comment in the field on the bottom left of the screen),
        and click the "Push origin" button near the top middle of the screen.
      </p>

        If everything worked, you should be able to play your game by going to:<br>
