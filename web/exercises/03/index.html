      <p>
        Create a small game that features <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a> in some interesting way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some ideas:
        <ul>
          <li>Make the grid the floor, and when a cell becomes alive, have the ground rise up (potentially launching the player in the air).</li>
          <li>Make the grid large and allow the player to change the state of the cell they are standing in (sort of like a Minecraft-like thing).</li>
          <li>Give the grid a memory and change the color of each cell based on various relationships.</li>
          <li>Detect certain patterns and have that spawn different types of entities.</li>
          <li>Use the Game of Life to generate terrains (maybe even modify the rules and Cells to support states other than alive or !alive).</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        I recommend that you avoid using 3d models from the internet for this assignment (unless you really want to). The point of the assignment is to demonstrate that you can be creative with your understanding of Unity and programming in C#.

        Feel free to start from this code, but you won't get very far with the assignment if you don't understand it, so look it over carefully.

      <h2 class="mt-6">Building your Project for the Web</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Open the Build Settings (File > Build Settings...)</li>
          <li>Click the Add Open Scenes button</li>
          <li>Select "WebGL" and then click the "Switch Platform" button</li>
          <li>Click the "Build" button</li>
          <li>
            When it asks you where you want to put your build, create a folder titled "web" in your game03 folder.
            Once you do this, it will take several minutes to build your game.
          </li>
        </ul>

    <div class="container pb-5">
      <h2 class="mt-6">Submission</h2>
      <p>
        Submit your project to github. Make sure your Unity project is titled "game03"
        and located in the "exercises" folder of your local github repository. To push it up
        to github, open Github Desktop, commit your changes (you need to enter a comment in the field on the bottom left of the screen),
        and click the "Push origin" button near the top middle of the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        If everything worked, you should be able to play your game by going to:<br>
